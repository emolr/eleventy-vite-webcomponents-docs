# Eleventy + Vite + Lit for web components documentation

This is a minimal setup that uses eleventy to generate a static documentation site, vite for pre-bundling lit element web components written in typescript, both for the components that are to be documented in readme.md files (so they can also be read on github), but also for web components used for the docs site with eleventy. Such components are located in ./eleventy/_components.
